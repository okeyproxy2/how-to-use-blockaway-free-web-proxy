# Potential Hazards of Using BlockAway

While BlockAway can aid in accessing blocked content or browsing anonymously, it's important to be mindful of the potential risks that come with free web proxy services. Here are some security and privacy concerns to consider before using it:

Data Security Risks: BlockAway may log your browsing activity, IP address, and other sensitive information, which could be utilized for tracking, targeted advertising, or commercial purposes. Free web proxies might lack secure encryption protocols, leaving your data susceptible to interception by malicious entities, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information.

Unreliable Performance: Free web proxies like BlockAway often contend with limited server resources shared among numerous users, resulting in slow connection speeds, frequent downtime, or inconsistent performance. This can significantly impact your browsing experience.

IP Blacklisting: As free web proxies are shared among multiple users, the associated IP addresses may be flagged or blacklisted by certain websites, causing accessibility issues.
